# Collaborative-Filtering-on-Health
This research adopts a collaborative filtering approach from several set of specify database data related to the user desire, the data used in this mining are; first, the detail of the user prescription base on the search parameter and secondly related string search pertaining to the supply search pattern. To optimize result and provide best recommendation out of the search strings, different search techniques are taken into consideration only when necessary in other to achieve the purpose of this proposed project. Although the techniques used cannot split in reality as all the techniques may be interwoven, but the focus that will be adopt at each stage focus on the three techniques explain above.  The various activities carried out and different modules implemented to ensure application feature behaviors are intercepted for the use of Collaborative Filtering Algorithm.
